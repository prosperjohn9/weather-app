Step 1:
Design Your Application
HTML and CSS:
Create a basic HTML template that includes placeholders for weather data.
Design CSS that allows dynamic changes (background, colors) depending on the weather data.
JavaScript Architecture:
Use ES6 modules to manage different components of your application (e.g., UI handling, data fetching, utility functions).

Step 2: Fetching Weather Data
API Integration:
Choose a weather API (WeatherAPI).
Register and obtain an API key.
Async Data Fetching:
Create a function using fetch wrapped in a promise or an async function to retrieve weather data based on user input.
Handle errors and edge cases (e.g., no data for a location).

Step 3: Displaying Weather Data
Render Function:
Write a function to update the DOM with new weather data.
Convert temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius as per user toggle.
Dynamic UI Changes:
Change the background color or add images that reflect the current weather.

Step 4: Implementing User Interactions
Search and Toggle Functionality:
Implement a search box for users to enter the location.
Add a toggle switch to choose between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
Event Listeners:
Add event listeners for the search input and toggle switch to trigger data fetching and UI updates.

Step 5: Utilizing Promises and Async/Await
Promises in Action:
Use promises for handling asynchronous API requests smoothly.
Chain promises where necessary to handle sequential asynchronous operations.
Async/Await for Cleaner Code:
Use async/await in functions to simplify handling asynchronous data flow.
